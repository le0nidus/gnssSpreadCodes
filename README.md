I wandered online and came to a conclusion that there is no repo that contains all of the PRN's.
I'll try to implement here as much as I can in my free time :)

Implemented:
- 🛰️ BeiDou B1C (B1CPp,B1CPs,B1CDp)
- 🛰️ GPS L5 (L5I,L5Q)
- 🛰️ Glonass CDMA L3OC (L3OCp,L3OCd)

TODO:
- Work on making main.cpp simpler, by adding a function in Constellation that prints all sats.
- Printing to file
- Add more codes! 🤓
